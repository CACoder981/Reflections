When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When you're working in a team, using different computers for coding or looking for a safe place to store your files in the Cloud. It makes sense to keep your files in the Cloud for backup and to prevent loss of data. Then again, it might not. It all depends on your circumstances.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
More control.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you

A clone is a copy of the master where developers make changes to code.
A fork is GitHub's way of cloning a repository on their website.
