It helped me work out where the new code was different to the old code.
In doing this I didnt' have to wade through the code listing.
It helped me focus on where the bug was introduced.

Having access to the entire history of the file would mean that I could
search more efficiently. 
I could also go back to previous versions.
It would enable me to go back as required if I needed to.

The pros of a manual commit is that you have control and can group logical changes into separate commits. 
The con is that you may not commit at the appropriate time.
The pro is that you don't have to worry about making a commit as
it will automatically happen.
The con of an automated system is that you have no control.

Git is a code repository that has the underlying design principle of 
connections between files.
This is a design consideration.
Google Docs (and other) have the underlying design principle that the
documents are not interconnected in the same was a code is.

Use 'git log' to view all the commits.
Use 'git diff ' and then the commit id.
Down arrow to move down.
'q' to exit back to the command line.

It means I can always get back to where I started.

Android coding! That's where I want to use Git.
